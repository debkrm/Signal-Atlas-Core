## 1. Method & Environment

Nothing below is inferred from the documentation. Every status is derived from an executed command, and each finding states how it was established.

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Interpreter | CPython 3.13.5 (win32) |
| Test runner | pytest 8.3.4, config `pyproject.toml` |
| Suite result | **79 collected, 79 passed, exit 0, 0.44s** (`python -m pytest -q`) |
| Warning policy | `filterwarnings = ["error"]` — warnings are hard failures |
| Static review | All 22 `.py` files, `configs/go_no_go_criteria.yaml`, both reconciliation artifacts |
| Dynamic review | 5 targeted probes against the feature engine and contracts (Appendix A reproduces them verbatim) |
| Statutory verification | NSE circulars `NSE/FA/56129` (24-Mar-2023) and `NSE/FA/64323` (27-Sep-2024); SEBI uniform-charge circular `SEBI/HO/MRD/TPD-1/P/CIR/2024/92` (01-Jul-2024) |

Status vocabulary used in this document:

- `VERIFIED` — claim reproduced by an executed check.
- `CONTRADICTED` — a reproducible check shows the claim does not hold.
- `PARTIAL` — true for a subset of the claim's scope, with the boundary stated.
- `NOT RUN` — the check requires data or an artifact absent from this repository; no conclusion is drawn.

## 2. Documentation Claims — Verification Table

| # | Claim in `CURRENT_STAGE_OF_WORK.md` | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | "79 passed in 0.69s (100% pass rate, zero warnings)" | `VERIFIED` (timing differs) | 79 passed in 0.44s; warnings promoted to errors by config |
| C2 | Phase 1A `PriceBar` enforces Decimal-only, finite, positive, coherent OHLC, rejects `float`/`bool` | `VERIFIED` | `contracts/price_bar.py`, validated at construction |
| C3 | Phase 1A `UniverseSchedule` is point-in-time, sorted, immutable, rejects duplicates/survivorship-style mutation | `VERIFIED` | `contracts/universe.py`, `MappingProxyType` + tuple freeze |
| C4 | Phase 1A deterministic fingerprints `DATA-CTNT-V2` / `UNIV-SCHED-V1` | `VERIFIED` | `contracts/provenance.py`; golden vectors in `tests/unit/test_provenance.py` |
| C5 | Phase 1B series reconciliation artifacts committed | `VERIFIED` | `reports/reconciliation/bhavcopy_545_reconciliation.csv` (138 KB), `bhavcopy_series_policy_report.md` |
| C6 | `EQ`→`BE` transition preserves continuity; eligibility is decoupled from price history | `VERIFIED` | `partition_into_continuous_subsegments` keeps a transition inside one segment; `APPROVED_EQ_ONLY_POLICY` gates entry only |
| C7 | "Zero silent forward-filling" | `VERIFIED` | Missing calendar dates are absent from result maps / return `None` |
| C8 | "Zero cross-gap leakage: indicators warm up afresh after any missing session gap; state never spills across non-contiguous dates" | `CONTRADICTED` | Finding **F-01** — `relative_strength_50` spans gaps |
| C9 | Feature engine integrates with the Phase 1B enriched records (`ExchangeSessionObservation`) | `CONTRADICTED` | Finding **F-02** — `AttributeError` on that type |
| C10 | "Fail-closed verification" / "refuses to compute lookbacks across unexplained gaps" | `PARTIAL` | Finding **F-03** — off-calendar bars are silently dropped, not refused |
| C11 | Snapshot SHA-256 `502c6424…` and `DATA-CTNT-V2-659aea8f…` reproduced | `NOT RUN` | `scripts/verify_historical_snapshot.py` hardcodes an absolute path into the legacy repo; the snapshot is not present here |
| C12 | 545 missing pairs = 511 `BE`-filter omissions + 34 delisting/ISIN cases | `NOT RUN` (artifact reviewed) | Requires the 743 raw Bhavcopy ZIPs under `data/raw/`; rerun not possible in this repository |
| C13 | "Authoritative criteria committed in `configs/go_no_go_criteria.yaml`" | `PARTIAL` | File exists but is **inert**: no code, script or test reads it (grep across `src/`, `scripts/`, `tests/` returns zero matches). Also contains wrongly-sourced rates — Section 5 |
| C14 | Phase 1C complete | `PARTIAL` | 11 of 12 engine features are correctly subsegment-bounded; RS is not. See Section 3 |
| C15 | `HOLDOUT_UNLOCK` absent, holdout sealed | `VERIFIED` (absence check) | No holdout partition, unlock token or out-of-sample artifact exists in the tree |

## 3. Defects — P1 (research-output correctness)

### F-01 — `relative_strength_50` leaks across missing sessions

**Location:** `src/signal_core/features/engine.py:201-205` (computation), `src/signal_core/features/indicators.py:403-448` (maths)

**Mechanism.** Every other feature in `compute_standard_features_for_instrument` is routed through `compute_indicator_on_subsegments` (`engine.py:131+`). Relative strength is the sole exception:

```python
# engine.py:201-205
rs_50_map: Dict[datetime.date, Optional[Decimal]] = {}
if benchmark_bars:
    rs_values = compute_relative_strength(sorted_bars, benchmark_bars, lookback_sessions=50)
    for bar, val in zip(sorted_bars, rs_values):
        rs_50_map[bar.trade_date] = val
```

`compute_relative_strength` then indexes by **record position**, not calendar session (`indicators.py:432`):

```python
past_date = stock_dates[i - lookback_sessions]
```

So the "50-session lookback" is really "the 50th preceding *record*". Across any missing session the true horizon silently stretches to 51+ sessions, and the value is published with no flag.

**Reproduction (Probe 2, Appendix A).** 60-session calendar, session index 10 removed, benchmark present on all 60 sessions:

```
sma_20 at first bar after gap : None      <- correct: segment restarted
rs_50  at first bar after gap : not None  <- spans the missing session
non-None rs_50 values returned for post-gap bars: 9
```

All 9 of those values have a lookback window that straddles the missing session (record `i-50` falls on the pre-gap side). The first post-gap bar happens to return `None` only because its record index is 10 < 50 — the correctness is incidental, not enforced.

**Impact.** This is precisely the failure mode `AGENTS.md` §6.3 and `WHAT_WE_ARE_BUILDING.md` Pillar 5 exist to prevent. Any momentum, cross-sectional ranking or RS-vs-benchmark filter built on `relative_strength_50` inherits contaminated values whenever a constituent has a `BE`-filter omission, a suspension, or a holiday-list mismatch. Given the Phase 1B finding that 511 of 545 missing pairs are `BE` filter omissions, such gaps are **common in this dataset**, not hypothetical.

**Severity: P1.** Contaminates reported feature values; invalidates C8.

---

### F-02 — `compute_relative_strength` cannot accept `ExchangeSessionObservation`

**Location:** `src/signal_core/features/indicators.py:426,439`

```python
bench_by_date = {b.trade_date: b.close for b in benchmark_records}   # line 426
s_curr = stock_records[i].close                                      # line 439
```

`ExchangeSessionObservation` exposes OHLCV only through `.price_bar`; it has no `.close`. The declared signature is `Sequence[Union[PriceBar, ExchangeSessionObservation]]`, and every other indicator normalises via `extract_price_series`.

**Reproduction (Probe 1):**

```
FAILED: AttributeError: 'ExchangeSessionObservation' object has no attribute 'close'
```

**Impact.** `SubsegmentIndicatorEngine.compute_standard_features_for_instrument` raises the moment it is fed the enriched observation records introduced by Phase 1B.3 — i.e. the layer that carries the series code and ISIN, and the only layer that can support eligibility gating downstream. Phase 1B and Phase 1C are not integrated on the RS path. The defect survives the suite because `test_compute_relative_strength_alignment` uses raw `PriceBar` objects only.

**Severity: P1.** Blocks the intended data path; invalidates C9.

---

### F-03 — Subsegment partitioning silently discards off-calendar bars

**Location:** `src/signal_core/contracts/exchange_series.py:457-500`

The partitioner iterates the *calendar* and appends only records whose date is found in it (`line 488`). Any record whose `trade_date` is absent from `expected_calendar_sessions` is dropped with no gap record, no exception, and no return-channel for diagnostics.

**Reproduction (Probe 3):** 3 input bars, middle bar on a date missing from the supplied calendar:

```
input bars: 3  ->  bars retained in segments: 2
segments: [['2022-01-03', '2022-01-05']]
```

**Impact.** A single stale holiday list or an omitted special session (e.g. a Muhurat session, a one-off Saturday session) silently deletes real exchange observations and shortens every downstream window. This contradicts the fail-closed invariant (C10) — the correct behaviour is to raise or record `UNEXPLAINED_MISSING_RECORD`, never to drop data. The function also does not validate that the calendar is sorted and duplicate-free, although its output is only correct if both hold.

**Severity: P1.** Silent data loss in a layer stated to be fail-closed.

---

## 4. Defects — P2 / P3

| ID | Finding | Location | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| F-04 | `assert` used as the output-length guard: `assert len(seg_values) == len(segment)`. Under `python -O` the invariant disappears. Must be `raise IndicatorValidationError`. | `engine.py:122` | P2 |
| F-05 | `compute_weekly_trend` has zero call coverage — its only occurrence in `tests/unit/test_indicators.py` is the import (line 35). | `indicators.py:564` | P2 |
| F-06 | Weekly aggregation bypasses continuity entirely: 12 records spanning 12 ISO weeks yield 12 weekly bars, with no gap detection, so a 10-week EMA can span months of missing weeks. Duplicate dates are also not rejected. (Probe 4) | `indicators.py:474-562` | P2 |
| F-07 | `validate_series_continuity` collapses duplicate records last-wins (`records_by_date[item.trade_date] = item`) while `available_records_count` reports the raw input length. The loader rejects duplicates; the validator the engine calls does not. | `exchange_series.py:339-341` | P2 |
| F-08 | Two independent implementations of the same `DATA-CTNT-V2` digest, with no parity test asserting they agree on identical input. Duplicate-engine risk under `AGENTS.md` §7.4. | `provenance.py:63`, `legacy_compat.py:49` | P2 |
| F-09 | `load_dataset_from_dict` promotes JSON floats via `Decimal(str(v))` and truncates volume via `int(v)`. Probe 5: `105.2` → `Decimal('105.2')`, `10.9` → `10`. The parallel loader `historical_snapshot._parse_decimal_field` correctly **rejects** floats (`historical_snapshot.py:113`). Two loaders, two numeric policies, and the lenient one is the exported one. | `dataset.py:188-255` | P2 |
| F-10 | Fingerprint is representation-sensitive, not logical: `canonicalize_decimal` returns `str(value)` (`provenance.py:60`), so `Decimal("100.50")` and `Decimal("100.5")` hash differently. Any reformat invalidates recorded dataset identity. Either canonicalise (`normalize()`) or stop calling it "logical". | `provenance.py:44-60` | P3 |
| F-11 | `InstrumentTechnicalFeatures` carries no series code, ISIN or eligibility marker, so feature rows cannot be bound to `SeriesEligibilityPolicy`. Nothing today prevents a `BE` row from reaching a signal. | `engine.py:39-60` | P3 (Phase 1D gate) |
| F-12 | The full continuity audit is re-executed once per indicator — 12× per instrument in the standard suite. Acceptable at 79 tests; O(indicators × sessions × instruments) at 500 names × 750 sessions. | `engine.py:77-131` | P3 (performance) |

No finding was resolved by weakening a test, and none of the 79 tests was modified during this audit.

---

## 5. Statutory Cost Schedule Audit (`configs/go_no_go_criteria.yaml`)

The file is inert (C13) and contains two sourcing errors plus two structural defects. Rates below are for NSE cash equity, the segment this engine targets.

| Key | Committed value | Correct value for 2022–2024 | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ipft_charge_rate` (line 62) | `0.0000001` = ₹1 per crore | ₹0.01 per crore before 01-Apr-2023; **₹10 per crore from 01-Apr-2023** (`NSE/FA/56129`) | **WRONG** — 10× too low for the post-Apr-2023 regime, and wrong (too high) for the preceding window |
| `exchange_turnover_charge_rate` (line 51) | `0.0000325` = ₹325 per crore | ₹325 per crore to 30-Sep-2024; **₹297 per crore from 01-Oct-2024** (`NSE/FA/64323`, following `SEBI/HO/MRD/TPD-1/P/CIR/2024/92`) | **PARTIAL** — correct for 34 of 36 months; Q4-2024 mispriced |
| `gst_rate` base (line 58) | brokerage + exchange + SEBI | NSE levies 18% GST on the IPFT contribution as well | **GAP** — IPFT excluded from the GST base |
| `stt_delivery_rate` | `0.0010` | 0.1% delivery, both legs | Correct |
| `stt_intraday_sell_rate` | `0.00025` | 0.025% intraday sell | Correct |
| `sebi_turnover_charge_rate` | `0.000001` | ₹10 per crore | Correct |
| `stamp_duty_delivery_buy_rate` / `stamp_duty_intraday_buy_rate` | `0.00015` / `0.00003` | 0.015% / 0.003% on buy | Correct |
| `max_volume_participation_cap` | `0.03` | Mandated band 2.5%–5.0% | Correct |
| `min_execution_latency_sessions` | `1` | T+1 | Correct |
| `prohibit_buy_at_upper_circuit` / `prohibit_sell_at_lower_circuit` | `true` | Required invariant | Correct |

**Structural defect S-1 — no effective-dating.** A single static rate cannot price a 2022–2024 sample that spans two NSE charge revisions and one IPFT revision. The schedule needs `(from_date, to_date)` rows resolved per session. Without it, the Phase 1D cost engine is anachronistic by construction, which is a `AGENTS.md` §7.2 violation independent of the rupee magnitude.

**Structural defect S-2 — rates stored as binary floats.** `brokerage_per_order_inr: 20.0`, `stt_delivery_rate: 0.0010`, `gst_rate: 0.18`. Any Decimal cost engine must ingest these as `Decimal(str(float))` — the exact rounding path `AGENTS.md` §6.4 bans. Store them as strings (`"0.0010"`) or integer paise.

**Structural defect S-3 — no consumer.** With zero code reading the file, `AGENTS.md` §9.2 ("verdicts generated from committed thresholds") is not yet satisfiable, and nothing prevents the file from drifting further from the circulars.

---

## 6. Test Coverage Gaps

The suite is green because the two broken paths are never entered. Coverage gaps that matter:

| Area | Evidence | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| `relative_strength_50` through the engine | 0 assertions on `relative_strength_50` across `tests/unit/` | F-01 undetected |
| `ema_200` through the engine | 0 assertions on `ema_200` | Warm-up boundary unverified |
| `compute_relative_strength` with `ExchangeSessionObservation` | test uses `PriceBar` only | F-02 undetected |
| `compute_weekly_trend` | imported, never called | Entire function unverified |
| Off-calendar bar handling in partitioning | no test | F-03 undetected |
| Exceptions under `python -O` | no test runs the interpreter with `-O` | F-04 undetected |
| Fingerprint parity between the two digest implementations | no test | F-08 drift unverified |
| `go_no_go_criteria.yaml` against the NSE rate table | no test | Section 5 errors undetected |

---

## 7. NOT RUN Register (fail-closed disclosure)

| Check | Why not run |
|---|---|
| Historical snapshot SHA-256 / content fingerprint / universe fingerprint reproduction | Snapshot artifact lives outside this repository; `verify_historical_snapshot.py` hardcodes an absolute path to the legacy project |
| 545-pair Bhavcopy reconciliation re-execution | 743 raw Bhavcopy ZIPs under `data/raw/` are not present; the committed CSV and policy report were reviewed, not recomputed |
| Any strategy performance, DSR, Haircut Sharpe, drawdown or walk-forward metric | No strategy, execution engine or ledger exists yet (Phase 1D/1E/2 outstanding). **No PASS/FAIL or GO/NO-GO verdict is expressed in this document**, because none can be computed |
| Cost-model rupee impact of the Section 5 rate errors | No cost engine exists to evaluate; the errors are established against the circulars, not quantified in PnL |

---

## 8. Phase Status Assessment

| Phase | Documented | Audit finding |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — Legacy assessment | Completed | `VERIFIED` via the committed reconciliation report narrative; not independently re-audited |
| 1A — Contracts | Completed | `VERIFIED` |
| 1B — Snapshot / Bhavcopy / series continuity | Completed | `VERIFIED` for the contract layer and artifacts; empirical counts `NOT RUN` |
| 1C — Feature & indicator foundation | Completed | `PARTIAL`: 11 of 12 engine features subsegment-bounded; RS contaminated (F-01), unusable on observations (F-02), partitioner drops data silently (F-03) |

`CURRENT_STAGE_OF_WORK.md` therefore overstates Phase 1C. The correct description is: *substantially complete, with three P1 defects on the relative-strength and partitioning paths, and two documented invariants (C8, C9) that the code does not satisfy.*

Phase 1D (execution + statutory cost engine) should not begin until F-01, F-02 and F-03 are closed. A cost engine layered beneath a feature layer that misreports lookback horizons will produce a GO verdict whose inputs are not comparable across the sample.

---

## 9. Recommended Remediation Order

Each item states its own verification criterion, per `AGENTS.md` §4.

1. **F-01 / F-02 — route RS through `compute_indicator_on_subsegments`; normalise record access via `extract_price_series`.**
   *Verify:* a regression test with a mid-series gap must return `None` for every RS value whose 50-session window would cross the gap; a test must pass `ExchangeSessionObservation` inputs and reproduce the `PriceBar` result exactly.
2. **F-03 — make off-calendar bars fail closed.**
   *Verify:* a test supplying a bar on a date absent from the calendar must raise, not silently drop; a companion test asserts sorted/unique calendar validation.
3. **F-04 — replace the `assert` guard with `IndicatorValidationError`.**
   *Verify:* the mismatch test passes under `python -O`.
4. **F-06 / F-05 — weekly path: reject duplicate dates, detect non-consecutive ISO weeks, and test `compute_weekly_trend`.**
   *Verify:* a missing-week fixture either raises or returns an explicit gap marker; bullish/bearish/insufficient-history branches each have an assertion.
5. **Section 5 — effective-dated statutory schedule with corrected IPFT and exchange rates, IPFT in the GST base, string-typed decimals, and a loader that reads the file.**
   *Verify:* a table-driven test asserts each rate resolves correctly on 2023-03-31 vs 2023-04-01 and 2024-09-30 vs 2024-10-01.
6. **F-09 / F-08 / F-10 — one numeric policy and one digest implementation.**
   *Verify:* `load_dataset_from_dict` rejects `float` prices and non-integral volume; a parity test asserts the two digests agree, or the duplicate is removed.
7. **C13 — make the criteria file authoritative in code**, so §9.2 verdicts can be computed rather than asserted.
8. **Correct `CURRENT_STAGE_OF_WORK.md`** so C8, C9 and C14 reflect the above.

| F-04 | `assert` guard in `engine.py` | Engine contains no `assert`; length mismatch raises `IndicatorValidationError` and survives `python -O` semantics. Five defensive `assert`s remain in `indicators.py:537,538,565,574,575` (see R-3). | **CLOSED** (residual R-3) |
| F-05 | `compute_weekly_trend` imported but never called | `test_finding_f05_f06_weekly_trend_and_gap_detection` covers bullish, bearish, short-history; probes agree | **CLOSED** |
| F-06 | Weekly aggregation bypasses calendar continuity | Whole-week gap → `(close, None, None)`. Intra-week missing session (4 of 5 sessions in week 9) → `ema=136.500000, trend=True`, emitted silently. | **PARTIAL** (R-1) |
| F-07 | Validator silently collapses duplicate dates | `validate_series_continuity` raises on duplicate date | **CLOSED** |
| F-08 | Two duplicate fingerprint engines | Clean and legacy digests agree (`a7a2c9790f` both) on the probed vector; both implementations are retained, so parity is test-enforced rather than structurally guaranteed. | **MITIGATED**, not unified |

### 10.2 Statutory schedule — verified against primary circulars

| Component | Config value | Verification | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| STT delivery / intraday sell | `0.0010` / `0.00025` | 0.1% / 0.025% | **CORRECT** |
| SEBI turnover | `0.000001` | ₹10 per crore | **CORRECT** |
| Stamp duty delivery buy / intraday buy | `0.00015` / `0.00003` | 0.015% / 0.003% | **CORRECT** |
| GST | `0.18`, base includes `ipft` | 18% on brokerage + exchange + SEBI + IPFT | **CORRECT** |
| `NSE/FA/46730` (≤ 2023-03-31) | ₹345/cr, ₹0.01/cr | Slab-1 rate | **CORRECT as slab-1** (R-4) |
| `NSE/FA/56129` (2023-04-01) | ₹325/cr, ₹10/cr | 6% rollback | **CORRECT** |
| `NSE/FA/61137` (2024-04-01) | ₹322/cr, ₹10/cr | Circular dated 2024-03-14, eff. 2024-04-01 | **CORRECT as slab-1** (R-4) |
| `NSE/FA/64323` (2024-10-01) | ₹297/cr, ₹10/cr | Circular dated 2024-09-27, SEBI uniform rate | **CORRECT** |
| `NSE/FA/73061` (2026-03-01) | ₹306.99/cr, ₹0.01/cr | Circular dated 2026-02-27; total ₹307/cr each side | **CORRECT** |

Schedule contiguity: **PASS** (no gaps or overlaps across all five rows). Date resolution on the current session `2026-11-11` → `NSE/FA/73061`, total ₹307/cr. A query before 2021-01-01 raises `CriteriaValidationError` rather than guessing — fail-closed. The config is no longer inert: `load_go_no_go_criteria()` parses it into Decimal-typed immutable contracts.

### 10.3 Residual findings

| ID | Severity | Finding | Impact on Phase 1D |
|---|---|---|---|
| R-1 | P3 | `compute_weekly_trend` accepts no trading calendar, so a missing session *inside* a week is invisible: the weekly close becomes the last available session and the EMA smooths across it. Detail: probe F-06b returned `ema=136.500000, trend=True` for a week missing its third session. | None — Phase 1D consumes daily bars only. Must be closed before any weekly-trend signal is wired into a strategy. |
| R-2 | P3 | `canonicalize_decimal` uses `str(Decimal)`, so `100.5` and `100.50` hash differently. Two datasets with identical economics, differing only in stored scale, produce different `DATA-CTNT-V2` digests. | None, provided fingerprints are treated as byte-identity of the stored panel, not economic equivalence. Needs an explicit statement in the provenance contract. |
| R-3 | P3 | Five defensive `assert`s remain in `aggregate_daily_to_weekly`; they vanish under `-O`. The `python -O` suite exits 1 via `filterwarnings = ["error"]`, so optimized runs fail closed at the suite level, but library code itself still relies on asserts for these invariants. | None. |
| R-4 | P2 (disclosure) | Pre-Oct-2024 NSE charges were slab-based on monthly cumulative turnover; the config flattens them to the slab-1 (highest) rate. Cost estimates for 2022–2024 are therefore conservative — overstated for high-turnover accounts. | Phase 1D inherits the overstatement; every backtest spanning pre-Oct-2024 must disclose it. |

### 10.4 Documentation and reporting defects

| ID | Finding |
|---|---|
| D-1 | `CURRENT_STAGE_OF_WORK.md` §3 contains the repository tree twice: the first block states 91 tests, the second is a stale duplicate listing 79 tests with old per-file counts, and the trailing code fence is unbalanced. Two contradictory test totals now sit in one document. |
| D-2 | The commit subject claims "remediate all ... F-01 through F-12". Measured status is 10 closed, 1 mitigated, 1 partial, 1 open. Per AGENTS §9.1 a completion claim must be computed, not typed. |
| D-3 | `indicators.py` annotates a local as `Set[datetime.date]` without importing `Set`. Harmless at runtime (local annotations are not evaluated) but fails static analysis. |

### 10.5 Computed phase gate

Criteria stated before the result, each evaluated from the run above:

| Gate | Criterion | Result |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | All P1 findings (F-01, F-02, F-03) closed under independent reproduction | **PASS** |
| G2 | All P2 findings closed; any residual must be non-silent or explicitly scoped | **PARTIAL** — F-06 still emits a value across an intra-week gap |
| G3 | Statutory schedule accurate against primary circulars, effective-dated, contiguous, fail-closed outside coverage | **PASS** |
| G4 | No regression: full suite green, no new P1 introduced | **PASS** (91/91, exit 0) |
| G5 | Documentation states the measured status without overclaiming | **FAIL** (D-1, D-2) |

**Verdict: advance to Phase 1D — GO, conditional.**

Computed rationale: Phase 1D consumes `PriceBar`, `ExchangeSessionObservation`, `PriceSeriesContinuityValidator` and the criteria loader. Every gate governing those components (G1, G3, G4) passes, so the dependency surface for the execution and cost engine is sound. G2 and G5 fail only on components Phase 1D does not consume — weekly trend (R-1) and the status document (D-1/D-2).

Conditions attached to the GO:
1. Restate Phase 1C in `CURRENT_STAGE_OF_WORK.md` as **COMPLETE WITH RESIDUALS (R-1, R-2, R-4)**, not "all recommendations remediated"; fix the duplicated tree (D-1).
2. Phase 1D cost outputs must disclose R-4 (pre-Oct-2024 slab flattening) wherever they span that period.
3. Close R-1 before any weekly-trend signal reaches a strategy; close R-2 or document byte-identity semantics before any fingerprint is used as an economic-equivalence check.
4. Do not treat the legacy fingerprint path as a second engine: keep the parity test, and delete `compute_legacy_dataset_content_fingerprint` once the legacy snapshot is retired.

## 11. Phase 1D Review — Cost Engine and Execution Simulator (2026-11-11)

**Commit audited:** `b0ceaeb` — *"implement Phase 1D statutory Indian cost engine and execution fill simulator"*
**Environment:** Python 3.13.5, pytest 8.3.4, `PYTHONPATH=src`, `filterwarnings = ["error"]`
**Suite (measured):** `106 passed in 0.90s`, exit 0 — up from 91. `python -O -m pytest` exits 1 via `PytestConfigWarning`, so optimized runs still fail closed at the suite level.
**Independent probes:** 46 executed outside the repo's test suite (hand-computed expectations, no reuse of fixture values).

### 11.1 What is genuinely correct

The **statutory cost engine is exact**. All 24 arithmetic checks matched a hand computation to the last digit, with no float anywhere in the path:

| Check | Value produced |
|---|---|
| Delivery BUY 100 @ ₹1000, 2026-11-11 gross | `100000` |
| STT 0.1% delivery | `100.0000` |
| Exchange turnover ₹306.99/cr | `3.069900000` |
| IPFT ₹0.01/cr | `0.000100000` |
| SEBI ₹10/cr | `0.100000` |
| Stamp duty 0.015% buy | `15.00000` |
| GST 18% on (brokerage + exchange + SEBI + IPFT) | `4.17060000000` |
| Total charges | `142.34060000000` |
| Net cash flow | `-100142.34060000000` |

STT/stamp asymmetry across all four leg types is correct, the sell leg carries zero stamp duty, the 2024-09-30 → 2024-10-01 boundary switches circular `NSE/FA/61137` → `NSE/FA/64323` on the exact date, the R-4 slab-flattening disclosure is attached strictly before that boundary, a 2019 trade raises `CriteriaValidationError`, and a float price raises `CostCalculationError`. Slippage math also matches: `0.0005 + 0.10*sqrt(10^6/10^7) = 0.0321227766…` exactly, adverse in both directions.

Three residuals from §10 are also closed: no `assert` remains anywhere in `src/`, the missing `Set` import is fixed, and the duplicated repository tree with stale 79-test counts has been removed from `CURRENT_STAGE_OF_WORK.md`. The status document now states the residuals honestly instead of claiming total remediation.

### 11.2 Findings

| ID | Severity | Finding | Probe evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| E-1 | **P1** | The circuit-freeze invariant is both unreachable and look-ahead. Limits are optional caller arguments and no contract (`PriceBar`, `ExchangeSessionObservation`) carries them, so a normal backtest runs with the freeze rule silently OFF. When supplied, the check uses the session **high/low** — data that exists only after the close — to reject a fill priced at the **open**. | No limits on a locked bar (O=H=L=1050): `FILLED` at 1050, i.e. a buy filled at the upper circuit. Limits supplied with open 1000 / high 1050 (circuit): `REJECTED_UPPER_CIRCUIT`, discarding a legal open fill because of what happened later in the day. |
| E-2 | **P2** | A bare `PriceBar` is silently coerced to `ExchangeSeries.EQ`, so trade-to-trade instruments pass entry screening whenever the caller passes a bar instead of an observation — the same fail-open class as 1C's F-11, one layer down. | Identical BE session: as `ExchangeSessionObservation` → `REJECTED_INELIGIBLE_SERIES`; as `PriceBar` → `FILLED`. |
| E-3 | **P2** | The latency invariant is a dead constant. `latency_sessions = 1` is hardcoded, never compared with the actual signal→target gap, and no latency is recorded on the result; `REJECTED_LOOKAHEAD` is never emitted. Config `min_execution_latency_sessions: 2` therefore rejects **every** order, including a correct T+1 one. | With latency=2: T+1 order → `REJECTED_INVALID_LATENCY`. With latency=1: a 30-session gap (2024-01-02 → 2024-02-01) → `FILLED`, result has no latency field. |
| E-4 | **P2** | `min_daily_turnover_crore` is parsed into the criteria contract and then never referenced by the simulator: the instrument-liquidity eligibility gate is dead configuration. | `grep` over `src/signal_core/execution/` returns no reference. |
| E-5 | **P3** | The non-default impact exponent path converts through `float()`, violating the Decimal-only accounting rule. | `alpha=0.6`: impact `0.0251188643150958` vs exact `0.02511886431509580111085032068`, delta `−1.11e−18`. |
| E-6 | **P3** | No rounding policy to paise. `PRECISION_4`/`PRECISION_2` are defined and unused; totals carry exponent −11 (`142.34060000000`), so the ledger can never reconcile to a contract note. | `total_charges.as_tuple().exponent == -11`. |
| E-7 | **P3** | When ADT is not supplied, the impact denominator falls back to the *current session's* turnover, which is not average daily turnover and understates impact on abnormally heavy days. | Code path inspection. |

### 11.3 Computed gate, Phase 1D → Phase 1E

| Gate | Criterion | Result |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | Statutory schedule exact across every component, leg, and date boundary | **PASS** (24/24) |
| G2 | Fail closed on non-Decimal input and on dates outside circular coverage | **PASS** |
| G3 | Circuit freeze enforced without caller-supplied evidence, and without end-of-day data deciding an open-time fill | **FAIL** (E-1) |
| G4 | Series eligibility cannot be bypassed by input typing | **FAIL** (E-2) |
| G5 | Execution latency measured against the trading calendar rather than hardcoded | **FAIL** (E-3) |
| G6 | No binary floating point in any accounting path | **FAIL** (E-5) |
| G7 | Zero `assert` guards; optimized-mode safety | **PASS** |
| G8 | Every configured liquidity gate is enforced | **FAIL** (E-4) |

**Verdict: Phase 1D cost engine — APPROVED. Execution simulator — NOT APPROVED for Phase 1E in its current form (4 PASS / 4 FAIL).**

The cost engine and slippage mathematics are correct and can be frozen; Phase 1E's ledger arithmetic will be sound on these inputs. The simulator cannot yet be the fill source for a ledger, because the ledger would permanently record fills produced under a disabled freeze rule (E-1), entry into trade-to-trade instruments (E-2), and an unmeasured latency (E-3) — and Phase 2 walk-forward results would inherit all three.

Remediation required before Phase 1E consumes fills:
1. Carry circuit limits as evidence (a field on the session observation, or a required argument resolved from a circuit-band source), and reject only when the **fill reference price** is at or through the limit — never on the basis of the session high/low (E-1). A whole-day lock (`high == low == limit`) additionally blocks the fill.
2. Remove the `ExchangeSeries.EQ` default for bare `PriceBar` input: require explicit series evidence for entry, or fail closed (E-2).
3. Compute latency in trading sessions from the calendar and record it on `ExecutionFillResult`; keep the `min_execution_latency_sessions` check against the measured value (E-3).
4. Enforce `min_daily_turnover_crore` (E-4), remove the float path for non-default alpha (E-5), and declare an explicit paise rounding policy at the breakdown boundary (E-6).

## 12. Phase 1D Re-audit After Remediation — E-1 … E-6 (2026-11-11)

**Commit audited:** `2852af8` — *"remediate execution simulator audit findings E-1 through E-6"* (10 files, +656/−252)
**Suite (measured):** `108 passed in 0.60s`, exit 0; `python -O -m pytest` exits 1 via `PytestConfigWarning`; `grep "^\s*assert " src/` returns 0.
**Independent probes:** 50 executed outside the repo's suite (40 first pass, 10 corrected/edge). Two probe expectations in the first pass were themselves wrong (latency index arithmetic, participation basis) and were re-run against hand-derived references before being reported.

### 12.1 Remediation status, computed

| ID | Claimed | Measured result | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| E-1 | Remediated | Circuit gate now evaluated on the **fill reference price**; open 1000 / high 1050 (circuit) → `FILLED` at `1002.736067977…`, where §11 recorded a rejection. Open at/through the limit → `REJECTED_UPPER_CIRCUIT`. Limits now travel on `ExchangeSessionObservation` with validation (upper ≥ high, lower ≤ low, lower ≤ upper, bool/float rejected). | **Lookahead half CLOSED; evidence half PARTIAL** |
| E-2 | Remediated | Bare `PriceBar` without `explicit_series` → `REJECTED_INELIGIBLE_SERIES`; `explicit_series=BE` and a BE observation → rejected; `explicit_series=EQ` → fills. The silent `EQ` coercion is gone. | **CLOSED** |
| E-3 | Remediated | Calendar latency measured (Fri 23 Jan → Tue 27 Jan across Republic Day = 1 session); 30-session gap records `latency_sessions=21`; `min_execution_latency_sessions=2` now rejects T+1 and accepts T+2; `REJECTED_LOOKAHEAD` emitted instead of a bare exception. | **CLOSED** (fallback caveat below) |
| E-4 | Remediated | `REJECTED_INSUFFICIENT_TURNOVER` fires below ₹5 Cr; healthy ADT admits the same bar. | **CLOSED** (basis caveat below) |
| E-5 | Remediated | `alpha=0.6` result matches a hand-built exact `Decimal` reference bit-for-bit: `1025.618864315095801110850321`. No `float()` remains in the path. | **CLOSED** |
| E-6 | Remediated | `to_paise()` and `round_to_paise=` exist, but `round_to_paise` defaults to `False`, the simulator never passes it, and `grep` finds **zero** references to either name outside `costs.py` — including zero test coverage. A simulated fill still returns `total_charges` with 25 decimal places. | **NOT CLOSED at the boundary** |

### 12.2 New findings

| ID | Severity | Finding | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| E-1-R | **P2** | Circuit protection remains opt-in and unpopulated: `upper_circuit_limit`/`lower_circuit_limit` are fields on the observation, but no loader, dataset builder, or reconciliation path ever sets them. The zero-range (`high == low`) heuristic catches a classic locked day, but a stock that **opens at the upper circuit and then trades lower** (open = high = 1050, low = 1000) has no zero range, so a BUY still fills at 1050 — the §5.3 prohibition. | `FILLED @ 1050` with no limits; identical bar with `upper_circuit_limit=1050` → `REJECTED_UPPER_CIRCUIT`. |
| E-4-R | P3 | The turnover gate compares an **average** daily turnover threshold against a **single session's** traded value whenever `average_daily_turnover` is not supplied (it never is, absent an ADT source). A genuinely liquid scrip on a thin session is rejected; an illiquid scrip on a spike day is admitted. | Session turnover ₹10 lakh → `REJECTED_INSUFFICIENT_TURNOVER`; same bar with ADT ₹10 Cr → `FILLED`. |
| E-3-R | P3 | Without a trading calendar the latency fallback counts Mon–Fri, so NSE holidays are counted as sessions — a silent overcount that can only make the latency gate *more* permissive. | Fri 23 Jan → Tue 27 Jan: 1 session with the calendar, 2 without. |
| E-6-R | P3 | The paise policy, when invoked, is correct (all fields 2 dp, `net_cash_flow == -(gross + total_charges)` holds). The defect is that it is never invoked, and `to_paise()` has no test. | `round_to_paise=True` → `142.34`; simulated fill → `142.6654823532891115284254431`. |
| E-8 | P3 | On a zero-range bar locked at the **lower** circuit with no limit evidence, a BUY is rejected as `REJECTED_UPPER_CIRCUIT` — conservative, but it discards a legally fillable buy and mislabels why. | `REJECTED_UPPER_CIRCUIT` for `O=H=L=950`. |
| E-9 | info | The `target_date > signal_date` structural guard was removed from `ExecutionOrder` and moved into the simulator. Same-session orders are now constructible. Defensible (it is what allows `REJECTED_LOOKAHEAD` to be reported rather than raised), but the contract layer no longer prevents the state. | Constructor accepts signal == target; simulator returns `REJECTED_LOOKAHEAD`. |

### 12.3 Re-computed gate, Phase 1D → Phase 1E

| Gate | Criterion | §11 | §12 |
|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | Statutory schedule exact across every component, leg, and date boundary | PASS | **PASS** (regression clean: `142.3406`, boundary/disclosure/fail-closed intact) |
| G2 | Fail closed on non-Decimal input and on dates outside circular coverage | PASS | **PASS** |
| G3 | Circuit freeze enforced without caller-supplied evidence, without end-of-day data deciding an open-time fill | FAIL | **FAIL** (lookahead resolved; evidence still optional and unpopulated — E-1-R) |
| G4 | Series eligibility cannot be bypassed by input typing | FAIL | **PASS** |
| G5 | Execution latency measured against the calendar rather than hardcoded | FAIL | **PASS** |
| G6 | No binary floating point in any accounting path | FAIL | **PASS** |
| G7 | Zero `assert` guards; optimized-mode safety | PASS | **PASS** |
| G8 | Every configured liquidity gate is enforced | FAIL | **PASS** (enforced; basis caveat E-4-R) |

**Verdict: 7 PASS / 1 FAIL — GO to Phase 1E, conditional.** Four of the five defects that blocked §11 are closed as claimed, and the two remaining ones are narrow, localised, and do not affect the accounting layer's design.

Conditions:
1. The ledger must post paise-quantized amounts (`round_to_paise=True`, or an explicit `to_paise()` step at the posting boundary), with a test for `to_paise()` — it currently has none. Without this, the Phase 1E ledger cannot reconcile to a contract note, which is its stated purpose (E-6-R).
2. No fill may be treated as a final trade record until circuit bands are populated from an authoritative source (pre-open circuit-band file or the surveillance/band feed) and the open-at-circuit case is rejected without needing caller evidence (E-1-R). Until then, fills should carry an explicit "circuit evidence absent" marker rather than reporting silently clean.

Carry forward, non-blocking: source ADT once per instrument instead of substituting session turnover (E-4-R); require a trading calendar for latency or mark the business-day fallback as approximate (E-3-R); distinguish lower-lock from upper-lock on zero-range bars (E-8).
